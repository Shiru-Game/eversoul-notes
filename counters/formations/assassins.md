# Assassins Formation

## Enemy Goal
- Instantly approach highest ATK soul and assassinate, bypassing frontline souls.
- At higher difficulty, it's very hard to survive (even with a taunt skill) and wipe them before they reach your DPS.

## Enemy Common Souls
- `Eileen`
- `Melfice`
- `Jacqueline`
- `Claire`: Technically not an assassin but her diving and AoE will be unreasonably strong in high difficulty stages.

# Enemy Front Melting Formation

## Enemy Goal
- Use a variety of souls with some of the following abilities (if not all) to melt frontline quickly:
    - Defense/evasion/resistance reduction
    - Single target damage
    - Constant AoE/DoT
    - Silence/stun/charm
    - Mana reduction
- The most dangerous strength of this formation is that their peak period is early, explosive yet subtle since it's in their sub skills. If you don't pay attention or don't have enough defense, your frontline will get popped in seconds.

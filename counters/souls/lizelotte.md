# Lizelotte's Counter Souls

## Petra
- Due to her damage sharing debuff, she can return damage to `Lizelotte` when hit.
- At higher stages where she has a lot of HP, `Lizelotte` might off herself in the process.

## Daphne
- She does have a immortality passive to endure `Lizelotte's` rotation but `Lizelotte` also has an ability to cleanse buffs.
- Based on investment, stage difficulty and ally souls, she can be `Lizelotte's` counter or the opposite.

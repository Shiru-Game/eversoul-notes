# Claire's Counter Souls

## Lizelotte
- She can burst `Claire` very quickly. 
- If you must play `Claire` into her, assign good supports with high sustain to heal up the initial burst.

## Jacqueline 
- **Worst counter, avoid at all cost.**
- If she is the target of `Claire's` dive, she will pull `Claire` back into the backline. This in turn leaves the ally souls very vulnerable.

## Claire
- Both will dive deep into enemy line. 
- It might not be so bad at lower stages but at higher stages, enemy `Claire` can single-handedly wipe the squishy backline so avoid this.

## Lute
- She can reset the line `Claire` created by flipping. 
- Although it doesn't look like much, having the line reset is very detrimental, especially for the melee DPS souls like `Aki`.
- The higher you climb, the more important it is to maintain that line.

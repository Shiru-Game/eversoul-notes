# Claudia Flex 

### Type: Aggro/Balanced

### Specialty: AoE/DoT

### Core: Claudia
- `Claudia` with her AoE can spread lightning DoT quickly, dealing high consistent damage. 
- When her mana is charged, she can do another great AoE burst with her ultimate. Due to that, she can potentially burst the squishy souls alone.

### Strengths:
- High chip damage.
- Good at AoE and DoT damage.
- Good bursts when mana is charged.
- Flexible draft, can adapt to a good variety of teams.
- Good type synergy.

### Weaknesses:
- The DPS souls are glass cannons.
- Vulnerable to anything gets pass the tank: snipers, assassins, AoE/DoT.
- Can be weak to constant sustain.
- Might find it difficult to finish high HP souls.

### Counters:
- `Adrienne`
- `Claire`
- [Assassins formation](../counters/formations/assassins.md)
- [Sustain formation](../counters/formations/sustain.md)
- [Sniper formation](../counters/formations/snipers.md)

### Recommend to play against:
- `Melee focused teams`: Highly recommended. Great when match with `Chloe` since she groups melee enemies from her taunt, prepare for `Claudia's` AoE to stack on them.
- `Average to weak sustain teams`: Normal rotation will chip the enemies weak enough to be blasted by main and/or ultimate but these teams often come in [front melting formation](../counters/formations/front-melting.md) so make sure your tank can handle the initial burst.
- `Single front teams without assassins`: Bruteforce method. This is an offensive race between the 2 teams to see who takes out the enemy front first. Careful when doing this in high difficulty stages.
- `Ranged focused teams without snipers/DoT/AoE`: With `Claudia's` AoE, it's possible to pop the enemy squishy ranged souls. Careful when doing this in high difficulty stages.

### Draft notes:
- *Tank*: Switch between `Chloe`, `Daphne` and `Claire` based on the situation.
    - `Chloe`: Group melee enemies.
    - `Daphne`: Damage reduction, deal AoE damage and stun.
    - `Claire`: Push the line, making enemy front and back closer for AoE.
- Try to draft aggressively with multiple offense mages.
- You need to evaluate the enemy when deciding the remaning spots, here are some of the common approaches I take:
    - <u>*They have a lot of melee*</u>: The rear is often safe, draft more DPS. *Avoid* teams with diving skills like `Eileen` or `Melfice`.
    - <u>*They have snipers*</u>: `Claudia` is most likely the target, draft more sustain.
    - <u>*They have strong rear DPS*</u>: Use `Adrienne` to force rear soul in front for `Claudia` to take down.
    - <u>*They have a solid tank but more sustain than DPS*</u>: Take out their tank often leads to victory so draft single target DPS.
    - <u>*They have a solid tank but squishy rear souls*</u>: Speed up and power up `Claudia`, she has the potential to snipe them with AoE. Make sure to account souls that can increase defense/resistance, heals and some ranged souls just have naturally high HP and defense/resistance.
- `Wheri` is the best support when you need sustain and don't want to use a slot for a second support, especially when she is the only support with the amount of healing she can do, she also has a cleanse.
- Try to put them in a position where they can focus their normal chip rotation on a dangerous threat, this makes fights easier.

### Templates:
- Here are some variants I used.
- `Standard offense`: `Claudia - Hazel - Dominique - Wheri/Yuria/Talia - [Tank]`
    - Balanced with healing, lightning DoT, AoE and DPS, buffed by `Dominique`
- `Hyper offense`: `Claudia - Hazel - Dominique - Mephistopheles - [Tank]`
    - With `Mephistopheles` debuffs and sub-DPS, allowing even faster bursts. Useful when the backline souls aren't being targeted.
- `Turbo AoE`: `Claudia - Dominique - Vivienne - Wheri/Yuria/Talia/Hazel/Mephistopheles - [Tank]`
    - Boost `Claudia's` damage and speed, good when you want to snipe squishy souls or burst melee souls through AoE.
- `Single tank burst`: `Claudia - Hazel - [2 sub DPS] or [1 sub DPS + 1 support] - Claire/Daphne`
    - Single target variant, focused on taking out the single tank. 
    - For the sub DPS, try to pick the ones with single target DPS, can improve damage/speed or reduce defense/resistance. To list the common souls I used: `Dominique`, `Vivienne`, `Mephistopheles`, `Lilith`, `Erusha`.
    - Don't forget about type synergy.
    - `Claire` can easily break single front formation and draw aggro. Careful with her [counters](../counters/souls/claire.md).
    - `Daphne` can counter damage and reduce damage taken for allies. Careful with her [counters](../counters/souls/daphne.md)
    - The rest of the DPS focus solely on the tank, `Claudia's` AoE still does damage to the rear souls.
- `Pick`: `Claudia - Hazel - Wheri/Yuria/Talia - Adrienne - [Tank]`
    - `Adrienne` pulls a soul in front to be targeted by `Claudia` and `Hazel`.
- `Balanced`: `Claudia - Hazel/Dominique - Wheri/Yuria/Talia x 2 - [Tank]`

### Manual notes:
- There are 2 ways to use main and ultimate sequence:
    - *Instant*: Use main skills and `Claudia's` ultimate as soon as possible, recommended when you have enough DPS to take out at least 1 enemy soul.
    - *Layered*: Use all the DPS main and `Claudia` ultimate together. By delaying, you can layer the bursts and wipe teams without giving them the chance to sustain or retaliate.
- `Dominique`:
    - *Main*: Can push enemy away, useful when you need to delay or keep your tank surviving for a few seconds.
    - *Ultimate*: Can lock enemies in place, useful when you need to stall enemies for a few seconds.
- `Hazel, Mephistopheles`: Their main is a straight line so you can align them to snipe if needed.

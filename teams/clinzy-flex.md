# Linzy (Thanatos) Flex

### Type: Aggro/Ramp

### Specialty: Bonus abilities on enemies' deaths

### Core: Petra + Garnet + Prim + Linzy (Thanatos)
- `Petra + Garnet + Prim`: A good defensive core, synergize well between defense and sustain synergy.
- `Linzy (Thanatos)`: On-enemy-death trigger, her S1 allows allies to activate their passive of on-enemy-death.

### Strengths:
- A solid frontline, high sustain with various defensive buffs.
- Decent fast peak.
- Snowball quickly on enemies' death.

### Weaknesses:
- Basic front to back, has to take down the frontline first. However, cetain flex souls in this team are capable of sniping the backline.
- Can be bursted down quickly if they don't heal fast enough, speed is very vital.
- Can be a little bit RNG-reliant.

### Counters:
- `Slow`: Rely on the initial sub-skill rotation to keep themselves alive, AoE slows proven to be problematic on higher levels.
- [Snipers teams](../counters/formations/snipers.md): With the team being reliant on sustain, if the supports are taken out then it will be *deathly*.
- [Assassins teams](../counters/formations/assassins.md): Similar reasoning. If the supports are safe then this is not a counter.
- [Front Melting](../counters/formations/front-melting.md): If the enemies rotate skill earlier (with or without speed manipulation), they might be able to break the formation by deleting the frontline.

### Recommend to play against:
- `Single front teams or melee DPS teams`: It's easier to melt single target down but be careful with tanks and sustain in high difficulty stages.
- [Sustain Team](../counters/formations/sustain.md): With `Otoha` as one of the flex soul, this team can execute enemies to prevent prolonged sustain fights.
- [Daphne](../counters/souls/daphne.md): Same reasoning.

### Draft notes:
- `Linzy (Thanatos)`: She has an odd inclination of standing quite far up, causes her to be targeted a lot. If you have trouble keeping her alive, put her in front of the 1-4 formation for extra bulk, if not align her where you see fit.
- `Petra`: Align her near `Linzy (Thanatos)`, sometimes she will pick up the aggro.
- `The rest`: Feel free to align however you wish.
- `The flex`: Take whichever is needed, look at the `Templates` or `Table` below

### Templates
- Here are some variants I used.
- `Shredder`: `Linzy (Thanatos) - Petra - Garnet - Prim - Otoha`
- `Sniper`: `Linzy (Thanatos) - Petra - Garnet - Prim - Sigrid`
- `Assassin`: `Linzy (Thanatos) - Petra - Garnet - Prim - Jacqueline`
- `Operator (Reset)`: `Linzy (Thanatos) - Petra - Garnet - Prim - Mephistopheles (Dawn)`

### Manual notes:
- Always spam `Linzy (Thanatos)` main first, she will most likely be near death due to her odd positioning.
- For ultimate, use the other DPS flex soul's and let `Linzy (Thanatos)` to stack up.
- Use `Linzy (Thanatos)` at later stage for more damage.

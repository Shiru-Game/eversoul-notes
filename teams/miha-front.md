# MiHa Front

### Type: Aggro/Ramp

### Specialty: Frontal assaults

### Core: Onyx + Mica + Seeha
- `Onyx`: `Onyx` buffs can increase max HP and attack by a great amount along with great offensive and defensive buffs, as long as no angel/demon/chaos soul(s) is/are drafted.
- `Mica + Seeha`: Constant AoE damage, healing, shield and buffs, both DPS and healing to support the main tank and any soul in range, their main goal is to establish a solid line with both offensive and defensive power.

### Strengths:
- A solid frontline, allow deployed souls to have a higher survival chance. 
- Early peak, once `Mica + Seeha` initial AoE got activated, they entered their strongest point with good DPS, high defense and hard to take out.
- Can burst isolated front.
- Good sustain, shield, DPS and buffs.
- With the addition of `Honglan (Peerless)`, the core team can now run a 4-1 formation so you can flex whichever soul you want to the last spot

### Weaknesses:
- Basic front to back, has to take down the frontline first. However, with `Mica` ultimate, it's possible to snipe the backline.
- `Mica` and `Seeha` aren't too tanky outside of their AoE peaks so if they are down, it will be harder to play.
- The back is exposed to sniping/assassins, can be mitigated by drafting them inside the AoE buffs range.
- Can be a little bit RNG-reliant.
- Might take a few tries to find the perfect draft and positions per fight, some are easier than the others.

### Counters:
- `Daphne`
- `Anything that peak after`: If the AoE DPS and buffs are active, this team is very strong. However, outside of it, the team falls off a lot in both DPS and defense. 

### Recommend to play against:
- `Single front teams or melee DPS teams`: With `Mica + Seeha`, it's easy to melt them down quickly but be careful with tanks and sustain in high difficulty stages.
- `DoT teams`: With constant healing and robust bulk, this team can nulify the constant damage but `Ayame` might still be problematic.
- `Snipers teams`: With most of the souls being melee, this team has higher bulk and when paired with sustain, it's less vulnerable to sniping. Even if the targeted soul is a ranged one, it's possible to counter by placing her within effective range of `Seeha` buff.
- `Assassins teams`: On top of similar reasoning against snipers, assassins being low HP melee make them the perfect targets for `Mica` to burst them all at once. Just need to be mindful of position, fit all the important souls in range of `Seeha` and `Mica` and let them do their magic. Be careful against `Eileen`, she targets lowest HP soul so it's harder for `Onyx` to survive.
- *[Front melting teams](../counters/formations/front-melting.md)*: Since these types of formation often peak early, it matches perfectly within this team AoE buffs and DPS.

### Draft notes:
- `Mica`: Align her against the melee soul(s) you want to burst.
- `Seeha`: Align her center or toward the important soul(s) you want to keep alive and buff/heal/shield.
- `Onyx`: Anywhere.
- *Main tank*: Despite the buffs, they will find it hard to survive without a main tank, especially in high difficulty stages. Any of the 3 main tanks are good.
- *DPS/Support*: Fill the remaining spot with what you need, I prefer DPS.
- Whichever souls you draft, make sure to maintain a good synergy for the extra stat boosts.
- The AoE buffs are very strong, it's so strong that it allows `Chloe` and `Mica` to tank `Lizelotte` single target burst. Try to fit as many important souls within the range of her buffs as possible, even the ranged souls like `Tasha`.
- Don't shy away from putting the ranged soul in front to squeeze everyone inside the buff range.

### Templates
- Here are some variants I used.
- <u>Double lines</u>: Led by `Claire` or `Honglan (Peerless)`, create a scenario where she breaks in between enemy front and back, separating them and establishing a line. Then adding a second line created by `Mica + Seeha`, pincer the enemy front.
    - `Ramp`: `Claire/Honglan (Peerless) - Mica - Seeha - Onyx - Aki`
    - `Auto peak`: `Claire/Honglan (Peerless) - Mica - Seeha - Onyx - Tasha/Sakuyo`
    - `Melee enhance`: `Claire/Honglan (Peerless) - Mica - Seeha - Onyx - Haru`
- <u>Enhanced line</u>: Led by `Chloe`, create an upgraded, more solid line with `Chloe + Mica + Seeha`, allowing DPS souls to safely attack or ramp. Enhanced `Chloe` here can potentially take `Lizelotte` single target burst and survive.
    - `Front melting`: `Chloe - Mica - Seeha - Onyx - Nicole`
    - `Auto peak`: `Chloe - Mica - Seeha - Onyx - Tasha/Sakuyo`
    - `Melee enhance`: `Chloe - Mica - Seeha - Onyx - Haru`
- <u>Counter line</u>: Led by `Daphne`, create a solid line with counter ability from her immortality and buffs from `Seeha + Mica + Onyx`.
    - `Front melting`: `Daphne - Mica - Seeha - Onyx - Nicole`
    - `Auto peak`: `Daphne - Mica - Seeha - Onyx - Tasha/Sakuyo`
    - `Melee enhance`: `Daphne - Mica - Seeha - Onyx - Haru`
- <u>Anti Claire</u>: Led by `Jacqueline`, she will pull the enemy `Claire` back to their rear while `Mica + Seeha + DPS` collapse, works especially well against teams without other frontliners.
    - The DPS can be any soul from the `Beast` or `Undead` faction to trigger the type synergy.
    - However, you can use souls from other factions as well if needed.

### Manual notes:
- If there are multiple threats, it's better to use `Mica` ultimate since it can do a surprising amount of damage and stun.
- If you are using `Nicole` in the `enhanced line - front melting` or `counter line - front melting` variants then do not spam her main, only use it if the target(s) has *Feather Brand* on them or hold until you can use her ultimate and main together, this will increase her damage by a lot. This doesn't matter as much for `Hyper Offense Eve Flex team` since her role there is mostly offensive support for `Lizelotte`. Here, she is one of the main DPS.

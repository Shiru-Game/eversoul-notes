# LizEve Flex

### Type: Aggro/Balanced

### Specialty: Rapid bursts

### Core: Lizelotte + Eve
- With `Eve`, `Lizelotte` can deal extremely high damage and have high bulk for a ranger.
- Due to their high DPS, it's not mandatory to draft good DPS or support souls, they are also less reliant on team synergy.
- With 2 remaining slots, a lot of soul combos can be used to counter enemy formation.

### Strengths:
- High burst damage.
- Stable high peaks throughout the fight, any skill from `Lizelotte` can be lethal.
- Can deal both focused and AoE damage.
- Flexible draft, can tech counter souls.
- Less reliant on type synergy, can play with 2-demon synergy.
- Can go into most (if not all) formations.

### Weaknesses:
- Heavy reliant on Lizelotte for DPS, this exposes the following
    - If `Lizelotte` is taken out/stunned/charmed/put to sleep then DPS falls off.
    - If `Lizelotte` can't quickly burst at least 1 soul to snowball then the tide will turn toward the enemy since the usual style for this team doesn't have the best defense.
- While it's possible to cover weak defense by drafting more support souls but that would take them away from other teams which is something I tried to avoid. By making this a hyper offense team, I try to make it less reliant on supports and leave the good ones for the others.

### Counters:
- [Lizelotte's counter souls](../counters/souls/lizelotte.md)
- [Snipers formation](../counters/formations/snipers.md)

### Recommend to play against:
- `Assassins formation or souls (Eileen, Melfice, Jacqueline...)`: Boasting high and fast bursts, `Lizelotte` can reliably counter the diving assassins with `Eve` mitigates a portion of damage. `MiHa Front` and certain variants of `Ramp` are also viable options.
- `High sustain formations`: With `Lizelotte` bursts, she can often take out at least 1 enemy before they start to ramp up their heal rotation.
- `Claire`: At high difficulty stages, `Claire` can be tanky, hold the entire backline or straight up solo them (if they are squishy enough), `Lizelotte` can wipe her fast or draft `Jacqueline` to lure her away.
- `Aki`: She can ramp really fast and oneshot most DPS, `Lizelotte` can match and oneshot her first, as long as `Lizelotte` is aligned to attack her and aren't being taunted.
- `Eve`: Any soul linked with her can do a crazy amount of damage and has high HP, `Lizelotte` is one of the few that can break through it. However, there are times when the linked soul specifically counter `Lizelotte`. 

### Draft notes
- *Tank*: Pick any of the main tank based on situation. Personally, I don't initiate tank pick with this team unless necessary.
- Avoid using good DPS or supports souls for the tech slots, pivot toward sub-DPS or utility souls like `Nicole`, `Honglan`, `Adrienne`, `Vivienne`...
- If you need a support, try `Prim` first. 
- If that doesn't work then try `Talia`, `Yuria` or `Wheri`, since these souls are very good and can fit in other teams, only use them if you really have to or can afford to.
- If you drafted `Adrienne`, change her [position](../positions/adrienne.md) to pull target accordingly, there are some interesting interactions.
- Be careful with `Adrienne's` pull, dragging a soul will cause `Lizelotte` to use her single target skill S2 on that soul. As a result, `Lizelotte` might not have enough DPS to burst the frontline soul.
- Another thing to be careful with is even if `Adrienne` pulls a rear soul, if there is a taunter on the enemy then `Lizelotte` probably attacks that enemy instead.
- `Lizelotte's` S1 is a straight line AoE so you can align her to snipe the backline souls.

### Templates:
- Here are some variants I used.
- `Standard`: `Lizelotte - Eve - Prim/Talia/Wheri/Yuria - [Tank] - [Sub-DPS/Support/Utility]`
- `Pick`: `Lizelotte - Eve - Adrienne - Nicole - [Tank]`
    - The sequence from `Adrienne` - `Nicole` - `Lizelotte` can burst soul(s) quickly.
- `Speed`: `Lizelotte - Eve - Vivienne - Honglan - [Tank]`
    - Simple use: With the speed manipulation passives from `Vivienne` and `Honglan`, `Lizelotte` is more likely to move first and burst.
    - `Claire` is a good pick if you want to change the battlefield, it makes it easier for `Lizelotte`, `Eve` and `Vivienne` to hit their skills against multiple targets.
    - If the passives of `Honglan` and `Vivienne` aren't enough, try the advance usage below:
        - `Eve + Vivienne`: Align them to clip as many enemies as possible or at least the annoying ones you want to stop.
        - `Eve` has a mana reduction while `Vivienne` has a knockdown (if her artifact is upgraded).
        - In combination with `Honglan`, this trio will completely shutdown the enemies' ability to use main/ultimate (slow, mana drain, knock down) if you time correctly.
        - As mentioned above, `Claire` can help to shape the battlefield to your favor but result might varied based on who is the enemy frontline.
        - This is very useful when you play against a team with annoying main/ultimate skills.
- `Anti Jacqueline`: `Lizelotte - Eve - Naiah - Prim/Yuria/Wheri/Talia - [Tank]`
    - `Naiah` can put her to sleep on the dive and stall her invisibility out for `Lizelotte` to attack.
- `Anti assassins`: `Lizelotte - Eve - Prim/Yuria/Wheri/Talia x 2 - Chloe/Daphne`
    - For diving assassins or ones that target highest attack soul, it's better to use sustain and taunt to lessen pressure on `Lizelotte`.

### Manual notes
- Generally, you should try to use `Lizelotte's` main and ultimate whenever available to reduce threats except certain cases.
    - In damage sharing debuff with `Petra`: Avoid using until the debuff wears off or cleanse it.
    - `Daphne` is in her immortality and her mana is charged: With how strong `Lizelotte` is, the return damage will be very brutal. Unless you can cleanse that buff, try not to put too much damage on her.
    - When you want to save the bursts for the threats.
- If `Nicole` is deployed, try to use her main against targets with `Feather Brand` if possible. However, her role here is offensive support, as long as she gets her rotation off, `Lizelotte` can handle the rest.
- Try not to spam support soul main, only use it when needed.

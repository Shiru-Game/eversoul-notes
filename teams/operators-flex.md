# Operators Flex

### Type: Balanced/Aggro

### Specialty: Offensive buffs/debuffs + AoE

### Core: Mephistopheles + Lilith
- `Mephistopheles` buffed by `Lilith` does a surprising amount of damage and she cycles through her skills faster.
- `Lilith` deals good damage and provides good offensive supports to firepower of the team.
- Combining AoE and both offensive buffs and debuffs, this core specializes in dismantle the enemy formation quickly.

### Strengths:
- Well-rounded offensive buffs and debuffs, allowing them to demonstrate more DPS.
- Can burst quickly.
- High speed.
- Good AoE.
- Can snipe.
- Flexible draft.

### Weaknesses:
- If `Mephistopheles` and `Lilith` combo is broken, DPS will fall off a lot.
- Vulnerable to snipers and assassins.
- Position can be tricky.

### Counters
- [Claire's counter souls](../counters/souls/claire.md)
- [Daphne's counter souls](../counters/souls/daphne.md)
- [Snipers formation](../counters/formations/snipers.md)
- [Assassins formation](../counters/formations/assassins.md)

### Recommended to play against:
- `Claire`: Since this team can freely tech `Jacqueline`, it's a very good [counter](../counters/souls/claire.md) to `Claire`.
- `Strong rear soul on the side`: If `Jacqueline` is drafted to the last spot, she synergizes well with the buffs and debuffs to quickly take them out.
- `Melee teams`: `Lilith` is great at dealing with a grouped up formation. If `Ayame` is drafted, she can bind souls from the beginning of the fight and delay their rotation with her S1, *this is my second go-to counter to `Aki` after `Lizelotte`*.
- `Ranged teams`: `Claire + Jacqueline` is one of the best combo to break ranged formations, `Claire` draws most of the aggro and deal an AoE burst allow `Jacqueline` to 1v1 safer while `Mephistopheles + Lilith` work on their magic.

### Draft notes:
- *Main tank*: Pick one of the 3 main tanks
    - `Chloe`: Group melee enemies.
    - `Daphne`: Damage reduction, deal AoE damage and stun.
    - `Claire`: Push the line, making enemy front and back closer for AoE.
- If `Ayame` is drafted, align her to bind dangerous threats like `Aki`.
- If `Jacqueline` is drafted, align her to be `Claire's` target or dive straight to the backline.
- If you align `Mephistopheles` correctly, she can snipe diagonally to support `Jacqueline`.
- The remaining 2 spots are quite flexible so draft counters based on what you need.
- My favorite tank to use here is `Claire` since she pushes the line and group enemies and she is of human type so it's easier to maintain high synergy.

### Templates:
- Here are some variants I used.
- *(Most used)* `Pincer`: `Claire - Beleth/Prim - Mephistopheles - Lilith - Jacqueline`
- `Backline sniper`: `Claire - Beleth/Prim - Mephistopheles - Lilith - Sigrid`
- `Bind`: `Claire - Beleth - Mephistopheles - Lilith - Ayame`
- `Front burst`: `Claire - Beleth - Mephistopheles - Lilith - Nicole`
- `Speed`: `Claire - Beleth - Mephistopheles - Lilith - Vivienne`
- `Slow`: `Claire - Beleth - Mephistopheles - Lilith - Honglan`
- `Mages`: `Claire - Beleth - Mephistopheles - Lilith - Dominique`

### Manual notes:
- Use `Lilith's` main/ultimate first before `Mephistopheles's` main/ultimate to benefit from the buffs.

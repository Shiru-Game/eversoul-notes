# Hanul Flex

### Type: Aggro/Assassin/Ramp

### Specialty: Anything

### Core: Hanul
- With `Hanul` as the core, she allows employing souls from multiple factions which lead to an extremely versatile and flexible draft.
- Other slots are flexible, allow great adaptability into multiple formations.

### Strengths:
- Highly flexible drafting.
- Varied damage types based on which DPS chosen.

### Weaknesses:
- Need to have at least 1 soul from various factions so you don't get to reuse souls from the same faction much.

### Counters:
- CC
- Taunt
- Buffs Cleanse
- [Delayed move souls counter](../counters/souls/delayed-moves.md)

### Recommend to play against:
- Anything.

### Draft notes:
- Make sure to have varied types to trigger her artifact's effect.
- Don't be locked into the sample table below, this team can employ pretty much any soul.
- Draft to counter or draft to support.
- If enemy has more sustain than offense, draft more offense. If they have more offense, draft more defense.
- *Main tank*: Pick one from `Chloe`, `Daphne`, `Claire`, `Honglan (Peerless)`.
    - `Chloe`: Group melee enemies.
    - `Daphne`: Damage reduction, deal AoE damage and stun.
    - `Claire`: Push the line, making enemy front and back closer and make more space for ally souls.
    - `Honglan`: Push the line, making enemy front and back closer and make more space for ally souls, various utilities when in ultimate form.
- Pick the rest as needed based on scenario.

### Templates
- Here are some variants I used.
- Be mindful of type synergy, since there are a lot of tech souls from different types, not every tech will fit in the sample variants.
- `Dive&Freeze variant`: `Honglan (Peerless) - Beleth - Eve - Hanul - Weiss`
    - Balanced between buffs, heals, DoT, DPS.

### Manual notes:
- N/A.

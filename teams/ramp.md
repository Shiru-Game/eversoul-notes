# Ramp

### Type: Ramp

### Specialty: Ramp

### Core (Flex): Aki/Catherine (Radiance)
- Doesn't have a fixed core, this team switches between `Aki` and `Catherine (Radiance)` as main DPS, sometimes use both of them together.
- Other slots are flexible, allow great adaptability into multiple formations.
- The main goal is to get mana to use powerful main/ultimate.

### Strengths:
- Highly flexible drafting.
- Varied damage types based on which DPS chosen.

### Weaknesses:
- Not too strong damage-wise before mana is charged.
- Type synergy reliant, can be a lot weaker without the stat boost.
- High maintenance, need to survive until mana is charged.

### Counters:
- [Claire's counter souls](../counters/souls/claire.md)
- [Daphne's counter souls](../counters/souls/daphne.md)
- [Snipers formation](../counters/formations/snipers.md): A high sustain variant will do better against snipers.
- [Assassins formation](../counters/formations/assassins.md): A high sustain variant will do better against assassins.

### Recommend to play against:
- `Petra and Daphne`: Due to their low initial damage, this team is less likely to be affected by the revenge mechanic. However, it depends on the souls drafted, some souls do good damage even before their mana is charged so be careful with that.
- `Squishy teams`: This team DPS can easily wipe them out once mana is charged.
- `High DPS teams`: If draft toward maximum sustain, this team can hold their ground and return damage.
- `High sustain teams`: If draft toward maximum DPS, this team can offset their sustain.

### Draft notes:
- Make sure to not break type synergy, the extra stat boost is very important to survive.
- Prioritize defense over offense, most of the DPS is from main and ultimate so you need the souls to survive until then.
- If enemy has more sustain than offense, draft more offense. If they have more offense, draft more defense.
- *Main tank*: Pick one from `Chloe`, `Daphne`, `Claire`.
    - `Chloe`: Group melee enemies.
    - `Daphne`: Damage reduction, deal AoE damage and stun.
    - `Claire`: Push the line, making enemy front and back closer and make more space for ally souls.
- *Main DPS*: Recommend to pick between `Aki` and `Catherine (Radiance)`.
    - `Aki`: Faster peak, stronger burst but squishier and doesn't have the utility `Catherine (Radiance)` provides.
    - `Catherine (Radiance)`: Slower peak, weaker burst but has constant and stable DoT/DPS. On top of that, her kit before using ultimate has very good utility.
- *Supports*: Pick 1-3 support soul(s) that contribute to type synergy after picking *main tank* and *main DPS*. Recommend to pick at least 2 supports, the last spot can be sub DPS, sub tank, support or utility soul.

### Templates
- Here are some variants I used.
- Be mindful of type synergy, since there are a lot of tech souls from different types, not every tech will fit in the sample variants.
- `Standard variant`: `Claire/Chloe/Daphne - Beleth - Yuria - Aki/Catherine (Radiance) - Flex`
    - Balanced between max HP buffs and heals.
- `Burst heals variant`: `Claire/Chloe/Daphne - Beleth - Wheri - Aki/Catherine (Radiance) - Flex`
    - High heals throughout the fight, useful when you play against DoT, AoE or early peak teams.
- `Maximum sustain variant`: `Chloe/Daphne - Beleth - Yuria - Wheri - Aki/Catherine (Radiance)`
    - High defense paired with sustain to ensure DPS soul(s) can ramp.
- `Turbo variant`: `Claire/Chloe/Daphne - Talia - Yuria - Aki/Catherine (Radiance) - Flex`
    - Focus more on speed and mana charging, healing is weaker so evaluate the enemy formation before using.
- `Defense variant`: `Chloe/Daphne - Yuria/Talia - Wheri - Catherine (Radiance) - Tohka`
    - With multiple layers of defense buffs, shield, heal and damage reduction. Despite being a bit slow, this variant boasts high survivability and can play well into assassins and snipers formations. 
    - `Tohka` can take the initial dive from `Jacqueline` with little health loss before she join the frontline. 
    - `Catherine (Radiance)` has a 3-second damage immune if her ultimate had been used, you can time this into enemy DPS bursts to nullify them, like bursts from `Aki` and `Linzy` mains since `Catherine (Radiance)` in her ultimate form has the highest attack in this variant.

### Manual notes:
- Don't spam support souls' main, use it at the right time. The main goal is to survive and burst.

# Hyper Offense Eve Flex

### Type: Aggro/Balanced

### Specialty: Rapid/Constant bursts

### Core: Hyper Offense + Eve
- With `Eve`, a hyper offense soul can deal extremely high damage and have high bulk.
- Due to their high DPS, it's not mandatory to draft good DPS or support souls, they are also less reliant on team synergy.
- With 2 remaining slots, a lot of soul combos can be used to counter enemy formation.

### Strengths:
- High burst damage.
- Stable high peaks throughout the fight.
- Flexible draft, can tech counter souls.
- Less reliant on type synergy.

### Weaknesses:
- Heavy reliant on hyper offense soul for DPS, this exposes the following
    - If the soul is taken out/stunned/charmed/put to sleep then DPS falls off.
    - If the soul can't quickly burst at least 1 soul to snowball then the tide will slowly turn toward the enemy since the usual style for this team doesn't have the best defense.
- While it's possible to cover weak defense by drafting more support souls but that would take them away from other teams which is something I tried to avoid. By making this a hyper offense team, I try to make it less reliant on supports and leave the good ones for the others.

### Counters:
- [Lizelotte's counter souls](../counters/souls/lizelotte.md)
- [Snipers formation](../counters/formations/snipers.md)

### Recommend to play against:
- `Assassins formation or souls (Eileen, Melfice, Jacqueline...)`: Boasting high and fast bursts, `Lizelotte` can reliably counter the diving assassins with `Eve` mitigates a portion of damage. `MiHa Front` and certain variants of `Ramp` are also viable options.
- `High sustain formations`: With the high bursts, hyper offense options from this team can often take out at least 1 enemy before they start to ramp up their heal rotation.
- `Claire`: At high difficulty stages, `Claire` can be tanky, hold the entire backline or straight up solo them (if they are squishy enough), hyper offense soul can wipe her fast or draft `Jacqueline` to lure her away.
- `Aki`: She can ramp really fast and oneshot most DPS, some hyper offense souls used here can match and oneshot her first, as long as they are aligned to attack her and aren't being taunted.
- `Eve`: Any soul linked with her can do a crazy amount of damage and has high HP, matching `Eve` is one of the best way to break through it. However, if you have enough damage to breakthrough enemy `Eve` team then save your `Eve` team for another team.

### Draft notes
- *Tank*: Pick any of the main tank based on situation. Personally, I don't initiate tank pick with this team unless necessary.
- Avoid using good DPS or supports souls for the tech slots, pivot toward sub-DPS or utility souls like `Nicole`, `Honglan`, `Adrienne`, `Vivienne`...
- If that doesn't work then try `Talia`, `Yuria` or `Wheri`, since these souls are very good and can fit in other teams, only use them if you really have to or can afford to.
- If you drafted `Adrienne`, change her [position](../positions/adrienne.md) to pull target accordingly, there are some interesting interactions.
- Be careful with `Adrienne's` pull, dragging a soul will cause the hyper offense soul to use her skills on that soul. As a result, they might not have enough DPS to burst the frontline soul.
- Another thing to be careful with is even if `Adrienne` pulls a rear soul, if there is a taunter on the enemy then the hyper offense probably attacks that enemy instead.

### Templates:
- Here are some variants I used.
- `Standard`: `Lizelotte/Edith/Aki - Eve - Prim/Talia/Wheri/Yuria - [Tank] - [Sub-DPS/Support/Utility]`
- `Pick`: `Lizelotte/Edith/Aki - Eve - Adrienne - Nicole - [Tank]`
    - The sequence from `Adrienne` - `Nicole` - `Lizelotte` can burst soul(s) quickly.
    - Positioning might be more awkward for `Edith` since she's a melee soul.
- `Speed`: `Lizelotte/Edith/Aki - Eve - Vivienne - Honglan - [Tank]`
    - Simple use: With the speed manipulation passives from `Vivienne` and `Honglan`, `Lizelotte/Edith/Aki` is more likely to move first and burst.
    - `Claire` is a good pick if you want to change the battlefield, it makes it easier for `Lizelotte`, `Eve` and `Vivienne` to hit their skills against multiple targets.
    - If the passives of `Honglan` and `Vivienne` aren't enough, try the advance usage below:
        - `Eve + Vivienne`: Align them to clip as many enemies as possible or at least the annoying ones you want to stop.
        - `Eve` has a mana reduction while `Vivienne` has a knockdown (if her artifact is upgraded).
        - In combination with `Honglan`, this trio will completely shutdown the enemies' ability to use main/ultimate (slow, mana drain, knock down) if you time correctly.
        - As mentioned above, `Claire` can help to shape the battlefield to your favor but result might varied based on who is the enemy frontline.
        - This is very useful when you play against a team with annoying main/ultimate skills.
- `Anti Jacqueline`: `Lizelotte - Eve - Naiah - Prim/Yuria/Wheri/Talia - [Tank]`
    - `Naiah` can put her to sleep on the dive and stall her invisibility out for `Lizelotte` to attack.
- `Anti assassins`: `Lizelotte - Eve - Prim/Yuria/Wheri/Talia x 2 - Chloe/Daphne`
    - For diving assassins or ones that target highest attack soul, it's better to use sustain and taunt to lessen pressure on `Lizelotte`.

### Manual notes
- Generally, you should try to use the hyper offense soul's main and ultimate whenever available to reduce threats except certain cases.
    - In damage sharing debuff with `Petra`: Avoid using until the debuff wears off or cleanse it.
    - `Daphne` is in her immortality and her mana is charged: With how strong the DPS is, the return damage will be very brutal. Unless you can cleanse that buff, try not to put too much damage on her.
    - When you want to save the bursts for the threats.
- If `Nicole` is deployed, try to use her main against targets with `Feather Brand` if possible. However, her role here is offensive support, as long as she gets her rotation off.
- Try not to spam support soul main, only use it when needed.

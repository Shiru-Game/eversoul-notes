## Notes
- Everything listed here is relative to my progress and experience so I can't guarantee that it will work well for you.
- `Flex`: A soul marked as flex means you can use a different soul that shares the same function. *Ex: Chloe or Daphne for tanking.*
- `Tech`: A soul marked as tech means you can use or not based on the situation, these often serve as counter for a certain enemy soul. *Ex: Naiah to tank Jacqueline, Honglan to slow.*
- The numbers in the table don't represent their position in a comp, you can organize them however you wish.
- If a soul only has 1 number then it's a fixed spot, if it has 2 or more then they are a flex/tech spot, you can choose based on the situation.
- `Peak Time`: Refers to the prime moment where the soul comes online, some peak early (`Mica`, `Seeha`), some late (`Aki`, `Catherine (Radiance)`), some can be stable through the fight (`Lizelotte`).
    - `Auto peak`: Souls that can come online by themselves through their sub skills rotation.
    - `Manual peak`: Souls that rely on their main and/or ultimate.
- If possible, try not to hard copy the variants, the ones noted there are the most used but not everything. There are plenty more variants and sometimes I break the core soul(s) so keep an open mind.
- Watchout for positions, this can heavily affect a fight, it could allow your DPS to attack the dangerous threats, dodge straightline skillshots, avoid AoE and so on.
- There some additional notes in positions and counters folders, check them out if you are interested.
- In the draft notes, you probably will see me repeat watchout for type synergy a lot. If you have a hard counter but it breaks synergy then don't mind and just go for it, that note is just a general rule.

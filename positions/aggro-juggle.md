# Aggro Juggle

## When to use
- Against overwhelmingly fast and strong auto peak souls/stages. [Front melting formation](../counters/formations/front-melting.md) for example.
- When your tank gets popped too early.
- When you want to put melee souls in front for the defense boost.

## Draft
- Put the sub tank/melee DPS in front.
- Put the main tank in the back.

## Battle
- In the fight, the sub tank/melee DPS will be targeted initially.
- Then, the melee souls collapse and your main tank join the front.
- This will sometimes juggle the aggro between them.
- More effective if at least 1 of them has a taunt to further juggle the aggro.

# Target Selection

- Unless influenced by skills, all souls select the nearest target for attack so you can align them to focus on certain threats.
- Some examples:
    - Align `Lizelotte` in the same row as `Aki` (or as close as possible), this allows `Lizelotte` to wipe `Aki` out quickly with S1 and S2
    - Align `Mica` and `Seeha` toward a certain melee threat. When they collapse, the AoE will stack and burst quickly.

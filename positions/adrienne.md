# Adrienne

## Deployed in the front
- In this case, she will pull early and dodge some of the taunts except for `Linzy`.

## Deployed in the back
- In this case, she will pull late *after* the melee souls have collapsed. This is useful when you play against formations that place their rear souls in the front to dodge her early pull.
- However, she is more vulnerable to taunts in this case.

# Claire

- Since she dives toward the nearest target, you can freely shape the initial battlefield.

## Dive toward melee soul
- This will create a semi-taunt situation where `Claire` absorbs all the aggro.

## Dive toward ranged soul
- This will break the enemy formation, their melee souls collapse forward while `Claire` is in the enemy backline.

## AVOID: Dive toward Claire
- This will cause both `Claires` to switch place and dive deep in the enemy backline.
- At higher difficulty stage, player is on the losing side. Due to their pure stat, enemy `Claire` can single-handedly wipe the backline (some bulkier backlines can handle it better) despite being a tank.

## AVOID: Dive toward Jacqueline
- Enemy `Jacqueline` will pull `Claire` backward into the backline, leaving the formation vulnerable to attacks since `Claire` isn't in front to soak aggro.
- This will be extra deadly if the enemy has a strong front to follow up like `Mica + Seeha`, they can potentially dismantle your formation without a tank in front within seconds. This also applies to the enemy, if you see that they have `Claire + 4 ranged souls`, try using `Jacqueline + Mica + Seeha + Onyx + DPS` and let `Jacqueline` pull `Claire` backward.
